- A handout containing basic commands and exercises

### Learning Outcomes
Someone new to GitHub can use this repository to practice the following skills:
- Edit and commit existing files in a GitHub repository
- Add new files to a GitHub repository
- Apply Markdown to plain text files
- Explore project history through commit messages and diff displays
- Add and respond to Issues

### Use for Learning
Interact with the repository as we practiced in class and explore concepts we didn't get to cover. Ask questions by adding a new Issue.

Above all, don't worry - **you can't break it!**
