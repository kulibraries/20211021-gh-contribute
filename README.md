# It's a Party!
## A training repository for folks new to GitHub

### Contents
This repository organizes a project to plan a party. It contains:
- Files marked up with [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- Issues describing tasks that contributors can complete
- A handout containing an exercise, Markdown cheatsheet, and GitHub glossary

### Learning Outcomes
Someone new to GitHub can use this repository to practice the following skills:
- Edit and commit existing files in a GitHub repository
- Add new files to a GitHub repository
- Apply Markdown to plain text files
- Explore project history through commit messages and diff displays
- Add and respond to Issues
- Fork projects for personal use
- Contribute back to projects using a [fork/branch/pull request workflow](https://github.com/dmgt/swc_github_flow/blob/master/for_novice_contributors.md), aka GitHub Flow

### Use for Learning
Interact with the repository as we practiced in class and explore concepts we didn't get to cover. Complete the exercise in `git-handout.md`. Ask questions by adding a new Issue.

Above all, don't worry - **you can't break it!**
